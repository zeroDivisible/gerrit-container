Docker Container
================

This repository contains a Docker container which has a Gerrit instance running within.

Only usable as test platform!
-----------------------------

This container uses `DEVELOPMENT_BECOME_ANY_ACCONT` which allows the user to impersonate any account. This is great for development and playing with Gerrit, however, it should never be used in produciton
